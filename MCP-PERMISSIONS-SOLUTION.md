# MCP Permissions Issue - Staged Solution

## Current Situation Summary

✅ **What's Working:**
- MCP server starts successfully
- Claude Code detects Durandal tools (`mcp__durandal-memory__*`)
- Database operations work correctly
- Storage-retrieval pipeline is functional

❌ **What's Broken:**
- Claude Code says "MCP server permissions haven't been configured yet"
- Tools are visible but not executable
- Memory storage/retrieval fails at runtime

## Root Cause Analysis

The permission issue occurs because Claude Code has **project-level trust and tool permissions** that must be explicitly granted before MCP tools can execute.

---

## STAGE 1: Project Trust Configuration

### Issue
Claude Code requires explicit project trust before allowing MCP tool execution.

### Current Status
```json
"hasTrustDialogAccepted": false
```

### Solution Steps

1. **Accept Project Trust Dialog**
   - When you launch Claude Code in the `claude-chatbot` directory
   - You should see a trust dialog asking if you trust this workspace
   - **Action Required:** Click "Yes" or "Trust" to accept

2. **Verify Trust Status**
   - After accepting, the config should show:
   ```json
   "hasTrustDialogAccepted": true
   ```

### How to Test
```bash
cd /c/Users/Donnager/Desktop/Claude/pog/projectDir/claude-chatbot
claude --model sonnet
# Look for trust dialog and accept it
```

---

## STAGE 2: MCP Tool Permissions

### Issue
Even with project trust, individual MCP tools need permission approval.

### Current Status
```json
"allowedTools": []
```

### Solution Steps

1. **Grant MCP Tool Permissions**
   - When Claude tries to use a Durandal tool, it will ask for permission
   - **Action Required:** Approve each tool when prompted

2. **Or Pre-approve Tools**
   - Manually add to config:
   ```json
   "allowedTools": [
     "mcp__durandal-memory__store_memory",
     "mcp__durandal-memory__search_memories",
     "mcp__durandal-memory__get_context",
     "mcp__durandal-memory__optimize_memory"
   ]
   ```

### How to Test
```bash
claude --model sonnet --print "Store this memory: Test message"
# Should prompt for tool permission
```

---

## STAGE 3: MCP Server Process Management

### Issue
MCP server may not be running when Claude Code tries to connect.

### Current Status
Background server exits after stdio completion.

### Solution Steps

1. **Ensure Server Stays Running**
   - MCP servers should stay alive for the duration of Claude Code session
   - Current server exits too early

2. **Fix Server Lifecycle**
   - Modify `durandal-mcp-server-v2.js` to handle stdio properly
   - Add proper process management

### Code Changes Needed
```javascript
// In durandal-mcp-server-v2.js
process.stdin.on('end', () => {
    // Don't exit immediately
    // Keep server alive for ongoing connections
});
```

---

## STAGE 4: Validation Test Protocol

### Steps to Verify Fix

1. **Start Fresh Claude Code Session**
   ```bash
   cd claude-chatbot
   claude --model sonnet
   ```

2. **Check Tool Access**
   ```
   User: "What MCP tools do you have access to?"
   Expected: Lists 4 durandal-memory tools
   ```

3. **Test Memory Storage**
   ```
   User: "Store this memory: I prefer React and TypeScript"
   Expected: Success confirmation, no permission errors
   ```

4. **Test Memory Retrieval**
   ```
   User: "What do you remember about my preferences?"
   Expected: Recalls React and TypeScript preference
   ```

---

## STAGE 5: Configuration File Updates

### Current Config Issues

1. **Wrong Project Directory**
   - Config was missing MCP server for `claude-chatbot` directory
   - ✅ **FIXED:** Added proper server configuration

2. **Missing Trust Settings**
   - Need to enable project trust
   - **Action:** Accept trust dialog when prompted

### Final Configuration Should Look Like
```json
"C:\\Users\\Donnager\\Desktop\\Claude\\pog\\projectDir\\claude-chatbot": {
  "allowedTools": [
    "mcp__durandal-memory__store_memory",
    "mcp__durandal-memory__search_memories",
    "mcp__durandal-memory__get_context",
    "mcp__durandal-memory__optimize_memory"
  ],
  "mcpServers": {
    "durandal-memory": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\Donnager\\Desktop\\Claude\\pog\\projectDir\\claude-chatbot\\durandal-mcp-server-v2.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  },
  "hasTrustDialogAccepted": true
}
```

## Quick Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (You Do)
1. Launch Claude Code in `claude-chatbot` directory
2. Accept trust dialog when prompted
3. Try to use a memory tool and approve permission when asked

### Phase 2: Code Fixes (I Can Do)
1. Fix MCP server process lifecycle
2. Update tool permission handling
3. Add proper error messages

### Phase 3: Validation (We Both Do)
1. Run comprehensive test suite
2. Verify end-to-end memory functionality
3. Document working configuration

## Expected Outcome

After completing these stages:
- ✅ Claude Code will execute Durandal MCP tools without permission errors
- ✅ Memory storage and retrieval will work seamlessly
- ✅ Test score should improve from 56.3% to 90%+ success rate
- ✅ Full Durandal-Claude Code integration operational

The core infrastructure is solid - we just need to resolve these permission and trust configurations!
