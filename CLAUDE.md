# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Durandal is an advanced AI assistant with persistent memory, intelligent context management, and automatic knowledge extraction. It's a Claude-powered chatbot system that maintains conversation context across sessions using PostgreSQL/SQLite databases and implements sophisticated caching mechanisms.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**DurandalAI (`durandal.js`)** - Main orchestrator that coordinates all subsystems. Handles CLI interaction, session management, and integrates all intelligence systems.

**ClaudeClient (`claude-client.js`)** - Handles API communication with Claude, manages streaming responses, and implements retry logic.

**RAMR (`ramr.js`)** - Rapid Access Memory Register system providing intelligent caching with SQLite backend and in-memory hot cache. Implements tiered storage with automatic maintenance.

**ContextManager (`context-manager.js`)** - Manages conversation context intelligently to prevent token overflow. Integrates with RAMR for context caching and implements AI-driven context optimization.

**KnowledgeAnalyzer (`knowledge-analyzer.js`)** - Extracts and analyzes conversation patterns, identifies key information, and feeds insights back into the context system.

**ClaudeMemoryDB (`db-client.js`)** - Database abstraction layer supporting both PostgreSQL and SQLite for conversation persistence, project management, and artifact storage.

### Database Schema

The system uses a sophisticated schema with:
- `projects` table for project management
- `conversation_sessions` for session continuity
- `conversation_messages` for full message history
- `extracted_artifacts` for knowledge extraction
- `ramr_cache` for intelligent caching

### Context Management Strategy

The system implements multi-tier context management:
1. **Memory Layer** - Hot cache in RAM for immediate access
2. **RAMR Cache** - SQLite-based persistent cache with priority scoring
3. **Full Context** - Complete conversation history in main database
4. **AI Summarization** - Intelligent context compression when approaching token limits

### Intelligence Systems

**Context Modes:**
- `intelligent` - Balanced context building
- `aggressive` - Enhanced context with more artifacts
- `maximum` - Maximum context utilization
- `revolutionary` - Experimental advanced context management

## Environment Setup

- Node.js >=18.0.0 required
- Supports both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases
- Environment variables configured via `.env` file
- Requires Claude API access

## Key File Locations

- Main entry point: `durandal.js`
- Database schemas: `claude_memory_schema.sql`, `durandal_migration.sql`
- Test files: `test-*.js` and comprehensive test suite in `run-comprehensive-tests.js`
- RAMR cache: `ramr.db`, `ramr-cache.db`
- Development backups and history: `dev-history/` directory

## Development Notes

The codebase implements extensive error handling, connection pooling, and graceful degradation. The RAMR system provides intelligent caching with automatic maintenance cycles. Context management prevents token overflow through AI-driven summarization and priority-based artifact selection.
